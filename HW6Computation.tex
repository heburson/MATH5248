{\Large Homework 6: Computations}\\
Due: Friday November 5, 2021 at Noon\\


\end{center}
{\bf Instructions:} Submit a pdf of your solutions to the HW 6 Computational assignment on Canvas. Remember that your work will be graded based on how well it meets \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1emM06_WRh_h941rsjtRE9fRVndJtfRKd9gyS3Fs_rFA/edit?usp=sharing}{the specifications. }


\begin{enumerate}
\item Martha is sending a message talking about how great her sister is.  Martha has encrypted her message using a Hill cipher with a $2\times 2$ key.  You know that she has encrypted the word ``best" to the ciphertext ``JCTF".  What are all possible keys to Martha's Hill cipher? (There may be one or more possible keys.)

\item Find all possible ordered pairs of integers $(x,y)$ with $0\le x,y<15$ satisfying the following system of congruences:
$$\systeme*{9x+6y\equiv 9\pmod{15}, 7x+12y\equiv 5\pmod{15}}$$ or explain why no such integers exist. 
   
\item Find an integer $0\le x\le 134$ such that $x^2\equiv 10\pmod{135}$. (Hint: (1) you will need to use both the Chinese Remainder Theorem and Hensel's Lemma and (2) there is more than one possible correct answer) \\
