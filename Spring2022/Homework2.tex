{\Large Homework 2}\\
Due: Friday,  February 4 at noon\\


\end{center}
{\bf Instructions:} Submit a pdf of your solutions to the HW 2 assignment on Gradescope. 

When working on this assignment, you should focus on the following goals:
\begin{itemize}
\item Demonstrate that you understand how to write a complete set of equivalence classes modulo $m$ and when two equivalence classes are equal. 
\item Demonstrate understanding of the definition of a unit/invertible element modulo $m$.  
\item Clearly and correctly apply the definition of divisibility in a proof. 
\item (Problem 4) Use examples to determine if a conjecture is true and then prove or disprove the conjecture. 
\item Write clear and correct proofs that meet the guidelines \href{https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/292043/pages/writing-guidelines}{linked on the Homework Assignments page in Canvas}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item[0.] If you would like any of these problems to be graded for proficiency with the core skills, list the skill and the corresponding problem. 
\item Write out all elements of $\Z_{8}$ using two different collections of representatives for the equivalence classes.  (Note: Your answer will have two different sets; each equivalence class in the first set should be equal to an equivalence class in the second set.)
\item Make a multiplication table for $\Z_{10}$. Use it to identify the units (invertible elements) of $\Z_{10}$.  What is $\phi(10)$?
\item Find a multiplicative inverse to $n$ modulo $2n-1$. You should justify that your answer is correct, but you do not need to structure your justification as a formal proof. 

\item Prove or disprove: For positive integers $n$ and $N$ and any integer $x$, $$(x\% N)\% n= x\% n.$$
%\item Show that $x^2-y^2=102$ has no solutions in the integers. (Hint: Show that the squares modulo $4$ are all congruent to $0$ or $1$ and use the contrapositive of the reflexive property of modular congruence.) (Moved to HW3)

\item Suppose that $a=bq+r$, for some integers $a,b, q$ and $r$. Using only the fact that $\gcd(x,y)$ is the largest common divisor of $x$ and $y$, prove that $\gcd(a,b)=\gcd(b,r)$.  (Hint: $x=y$ if and only if $x\le y$ and $x\ge y$.)

\end{enumerate}
